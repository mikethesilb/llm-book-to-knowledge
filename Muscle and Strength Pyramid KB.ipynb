There is no avoiding monitoring and manipulating your body weight to some degree in weight-class sports such as powerlifting or weightlifting, and the practice of regularly weighing oneself and tracking one’s food is also associated with greater incidence of disordered eating, and poorer body image [11].\\nFor all of the above reasons, it’s very important to consider if, why, how, when, and how much you’ll track your food and body weight. Going back to the differences between competitive and recreational physique competitors and strength athletes, consider that without a specific weight class cutoff, or the requirement of getting on stage to have your appearance judged in competition, you might be able to achieve your goals without regularly tracking your calories, macros or body weight. In fact, beyond just being possible, it might be better if you can avoid long-term, continuous tracking. Sit with that for a moment, and we’ll come back to it later in this chapter and I’ll cover how to do this in bits throughout the text, and in detail at the end of the book in the Behavior and Lifestyle chapter.\\nAccuracy, Flexibility, and Consistency\\nImplementing quantitative changes to your diet is all about balancing these three qualities.

Unfortunately, when the season ends the challenge doesn’t. To get on stage you have to overcome all the internal signals telling you to eat and gain weight. Then, you step off the stage after the last show of the season and you somehow have to find your way back to health, both mentally and physically.

There is no avoiding monitoring and manipulating your body weight to some degree in weight-class sports such as powerlifting or weightlifting, and the practice of regularly weighing oneself and tracking one’s food is also associated with greater incidence of disordered eating, and poorer body image [11].\\nFor all of the above reasons, it’s very important to consider if, why, how, when, and how much you’ll track your food and body weight. Going back to the differences between competitive and recreational physique competitors and strength athletes, consider that without a specific weight class cutoff, or the requirement of getting on stage to have your appearance judged in competition, you might be able to achieve your goals without regularly tracking your calories, macros or body weight. In fact, beyond just being possible, it might be better if you can avoid long-term, continuous tracking. Sit with that for a moment, and we’ll come back to it later in this chapter and I’ll cover how to do this in bits throughout the text, and in detail at the end of the book in the Behavior and Lifestyle chapter.\\nAccuracy, Flexibility, and Consistency\\nImplementing quantitative changes to your diet is all about balancing these three qualities. If you become overly focused and accurate, you’re going to lose some of your flexibility, you’re going to lose your sanity, and inevitably you’re going to make a diet very difficult to follow.\\nWe only have so many things that we can focus on at a time, and our willpower and ability to juggle and handle multiple stresses is not infinite.

Different goals are going to require different levels of accuracy, but they all require consistency, which means adapting your flexibility to your goal. In research, dietary restraint is highly associated with folks who can lose weight, but flexible dietary restraint is associated with those who lose weight, keep it off, and stay sane while doing so [12]. So determining the appropriate amount of flexibility for your situation is very important.\\nFor example, a bodybuilder who is in the final stages of prep trying to get shredded glutes is going to need more accuracy than someone who has an undetermined time limit to lose 100 lb. Likewise, a bodybuilder in the off-season trying to put on muscle mass is going to have different accuracy requirements from a bodybuilder during contest prep, or from someone who is trying to get lean but isn’t a bodybuilder and is just trying to shape up for the summer.\\nThe more accurate you are, perhaps the more consistent you will be in hitting your targets and achieving your goals. However, you might also be more stressed depending on how rigid you are in your pursuit of accuracy, which could negatively impact long-term consistency. The less accurate you are, the more flexible you might be. But if you are too inaccurate and way too flexible to the point where you’re not consistent, you won’t get to your goals.\\nAs you can see, this is a balancing act that must always be appreciated when considering nutrition.

But you can’t have a strict meal plan while you go on vacation, you can’t have a strict meal plan and go out to eat, and you can’t have a strict meal plan without getting into the mental traps of not knowing what to do when you’re off it. If meal plans aren’t flexible (e.g. provide options at each meal and tell you the calories or macros), they don’t teach you about nutrition, they tend to be socially isolating and when following them you don’t learn how to integrate nutritional knowledge into your lifestyle. In many cases, strict meal plans won’t help you get to your long-term goals. They can be a short-term solution.\\nConsider that most people in this day and age are great at losing weight; the larger problem is that they just can’t keep it off. This is why we need long-term solutions, and this is why I don’t advocate rigid meal plans.\\nThat being said, there’s nothing wrong with having meal plans so you can get an idea of what the daily structure of a healthy, performance- supporting eating schedule might look like, or if you are going to track, how to hit your macros (which is a concept we will fully cover in Level 2 of The Pyramid). By seeing a couple of different examples, trying them out, and then learning how to make variations on the plan, or diverge from the plans while still hitting your targets (if you are tracking), you can teach yourself to navigate your nutrition on your own.\\nSo I would highly recommend that if you do use meal plans that they’re a learning tool in your quest for flexibility and consistency, rather than a final outcome.

This term means that while these foods contribute to your calorie (Level 1 of The Pyramid) and macronutrient counts (Level 2 of The Pyramid), they won’t do much to satisfy your micronutrient requirements (Level 3 of The Pyramid). While this description is relatively accurate, it doesn’t mean these foods should be villainized and completely avoided.\\nThe main thing to be aware of is that “empty calorie” foods can only cause issues if they dominate your diet (as an aside, this is more likely to happen when dieting).

This means you will have a particular amount of dietary fats, carbohydrates, and protein to consume each day, in grams.\\nThat being said, they are still just numbers. You’ve decided they fit your needs based on this guide, but remember it’s not like they are the end- all-be-all. They will change over your lifetime as you get older, gain and lose weight, change your activity levels, or as you experiment and find out what works best for you. Also, most of the time, ideally we shouldn’t have to quantitatively track them (more on this later in the book).\\nTo illustrate why being too attached is not necessarily a good thing, let’s say you were supposed to hit between 190 and 210 grams of carbs. You “blew it” and ate 215, then because you have an all-or-nothing mindset, you go eat that same pizza we talked about earlier as if you’d been on a rigid meal plan. The problem here was obviously the pizza, not the 215 grams of carbs that put you 5 grams over your range.\\nSo don’t put your macros on a pedestal as this defeats the purpose of why we provide quantifiable numbers in the first place. You’re not going to always be 100% accurate, sometimes you’ll mis-track, sometimes you’ll misread the label, sometimes you’ll look up and just realize you just kind of blew it and went over. Just stop there, and get back on track the next day. Like a meal plan, the macros you are targeting aren’t magic.\\nIt’s good to be consistent, but don’t get into the black-and-white thinking of being either “On my macros,” or “I’m off, so I might as well just give in and say screw it.” That’s what we want to avoid.

When you are starting out, tracking helps you understand how your habits compare to general portion sizes, see what foods are dominant in which macronutrients, gain awareness of mindless eating, observe the effect that your eating habits have on your body, and teaches you how to structure a basic diet for health and performance. Additionally, there are time points throughout your life where it is useful to once again track your food and weight. These time points occur intermittently such as if you go through a fat loss phase, and despite making qualitative changes, you plateau, so you use tracking and weighing as a “check-in” to evaluate why progress might have ceased. Likewise, in a non-dieting state, you might use tracking as an “audit” to ensure the habits you’ve picked up are still serving you the way you think they are (more on this to come at the end of this book). Outside of those scenarios, non-competitors shouldn’t be tracking regularly because the more you rely on external cues (body weight, calorie tracking, etc.) the more you can lose touch with internal cues (hunger, satiety) which can lead to disordered eating [15].\\nBut if you need to track and weigh, you’ll require a food and a body weight scale.

As an example, let’s do a calculation for a male that weighs 200 lb (90 kg), when we multiply by 10 (22) we get a theoretical baseline of 2000 calories.\\nStep 1: Baseline Multiplier; Not Accounting for Any Activity\\n200 lbs x 10 = 2000 calories\\nThen we multiply that by an activity multiplier. Now when I say “activity”, it’s not just dependent on whether you’re a construction worker or sitting at a desk all day, a full-time athlete, or a weekend warrior. This also includes something called NEAT, which stands for non-exercise activity thermogenesis. Or more simply put, any activity outside of exercise, including subconscious movement.\\nSo yes, someone sedentary will have a lower maintenance than someone highly active, but a part of the reason there is such large individual variation is that NEAT is one of the main ways we regulate energy expenditure. Meaning, if we diet and lose weight, or eat more food and gain weight, our body typically will adapt to some degree to maintain our “normal weight”. It does this by making us burn more or fewer calories, and a lot of that is a function of just fidgeting, postural support and control, and subconscious movement. It’s not something we can really modify. Some people will sit at their desk all day and burn a whole lot more calories than I ever will, simply because I have a “thrifty metabolism” [3].' metadata={} - Preview: - To estimate maintenance calories, multiply body weight in pounds by 10 (or body weight in kilograms by 22) and then multiply by an activity multiplier.\n",

      "Summary for doc page_content='Reason being, you are using a short-term period of 2 weeks and you haven’t manipulated your diet to result in significant changes in body weight or expenditure yet. Thus, changes in weight are predominantly fat and water and using a 7-day average will eliminate the “noise” of water weight fluctuations. So, you can be reasonably sure that the short- term changes in body weight you observe will be well represented by the “3500 calorie rule.”\\nThe only time I wouldn’t advise using this method is if you just started training or are just coming off from a training layoff or injury, as in this case muscle mass can rapidly change and potentially invalidate the equations. However, if you are a natural lifter not coming back from a layoff, not a complete novice lifting for the first time, and if you are relatively weight stable, this is a very easy way to estimate maintenance calories with appropriate accuracy.\\nHypothetically, if you gained 1 lb (~0.5 kg) of fat in a week, you would be, on average, consuming ~500 calories more than your maintenance per day, as 7 days x 500 calories = 3500. So if you only gained 0.2 lb (~0.1 kg), you simply multiply 3500 x 0.2, which is 700 calories. Meaning, in the above example you are in a weekly surplus of ~700 calories.\\nOn a day to day basis, on average, that means you are consuming 100 calories more than your maintenance (700 calories divided by 7 days). Thus, you know that since your average intake over 14 days was 2100 calories, you know maintenance is roughly 2000 (2100 - 100 calories).\\nThat said, if there is some sort of time constraint keeping you from this 2-week recommended method of determining maintenance calories, a secondary approach would be to roughly estimate using some basic calculations. Just be warned that it can be far less accurate than actual tracking, but can still yield some sensible results.\\nENERGY BALANCE 46' metadata={} - Preview: - Using a 7-day average of body weight can eliminate the \"noise\" of water weight fluctuations.\n",

Likewise, subjectively decreasing energy based on satiety and hunger cues may even allow you to accomplish mild cuts that don’t take you to unsustainable levels of leanness. To reduce or increase energy intake qualitatively, modify your energy intake subjectively by assessing your satiety after meals. For example, if you are not gaining weight at an appropriate rate, try to be more full, and eat more calorie dense foods. If you are not seeing visual changes in leanness every 2–3 weeks (or weight loss on the scale, if you don’t feel like you can visually assess this) while trying to lose fat, try to be less full after meals, and eat more fibrous, high-protein, low-calorie foods that provide more satiety with less energy.' metadata={} - Preview: - Tracking caloric intake as a first step may not be necessary\n",

Specifically, if you tracked and weighed Mon-Fri and but you didn’t on the weekends when you typically go out to eat more, that’s probably not going to be accurate. Do your best to record all your habits, don’t judge them or modify them, and estimate as best as possible when eating out. So, if you’ve done that, let’s say as an example, this value came out to 2100 calories.\\nThen, split your weigh-ins into 2 weekly averages, by adding your first 7 weigh-ins together and dividing by 7 and doing the same thing with your last 7 weigh-ins as seen below.\\n   BODY WEIGHT\\n  Week 1\\n141.7\\n142.1\\n142.7\\n141.7\\n142.5\\n141.9\\n142.1 Average ~142.1 lbs\\nWeek 2\\n141.8\\n142.2\\n143.0\\n1v41.7\\n142.5\\n142.8\\n142.0 Average ~142.3 lbs\\n                  Now you see that you are slowly gaining weight.

Now when I say “activity”, it’s not just dependent on whether you’re a construction worker or sitting at a desk all day, a full-time athlete, or a weekend warrior. This also includes something called NEAT, which stands for non-exercise activity thermogenesis. Or more simply put, any activity outside of exercise, including subconscious movement.\\nSo yes, someone sedentary will have a lower maintenance than someone highly active, but a part of the reason there is such large individual variation is that NEAT is one of the main ways we regulate energy expenditure. Meaning, if we diet and lose weight, or eat more food and gain weight, our body typically will adapt to some degree to maintain our “normal weight”. It does this by making us burn more or fewer calories, and a lot of that is a function of just fidgeting, postural support and control, and subconscious movement. It’s not something we can really modify. Some people will sit at their desk all day and burn a whole lot more calories than I ever will, simply because I have a “thrifty metabolism” [3].\\nAdditionally, almost everyone reading this book will probably (or should, in most cases) fall in the range of lifting weights 3–6 times per week. So, taking into account individual variability and also your exercise schedule, we can use the numerical range of 1.3 to 2.2 as an activity multiplier.

However, if you want to get started faster, just take the middle value of 1.7 as your multiplier. Then, if you gain or lose weight too quickly after 2–3 weeks, just adjust your intake.

Likewise, subjectively decreasing energy based on satiety and hunger cues may even allow you to accomplish mild cuts that don’t take you to unsustainable levels of leanness. To reduce or increase energy intake qualitatively, modify your energy intake subjectively by assessing your satiety after meals. For example, if you are not gaining weight at an appropriate rate, try to be more full, and eat more calorie dense foods. If you are not seeing visual changes in leanness every 2–3 weeks (or weight loss on the scale, if you don’t feel like you can visually assess this) while trying to lose fat, try to be less full after meals, and eat more fibrous, high-protein, low-calorie foods that provide more satiety with less energy.\\nNot convinced? Feel like this is a less committed cop-out to tracking macros or that you might not be able to reach your goals without tracking? Something to keep in mind is that muscle gain has occurred in every study I’ve ever seen where well-designed resistance training was used as an intervention in untrained individuals, regardless of whether the participants tracked their nutrition or not. How? Because their hunger went up and they consumed more food to provide the energy needed to grow muscle. See? It’s almost like our bodies have some natural system of regulating energy intake and output — oh that’s right it’s called hunger and satiety! On a serious note, I’ll discuss these concepts in more depth in the Behavior and Lifestyle chapter; also, to do this blended approach of internal energy regulation based on the external cue of body weight change, you have to know what appropriate rates of weight gain and loss are in the first place.\\nENERGY BALANCE 49' metadata={} - Preview: - Energy balance is important for weight gain or weight loss.\n",

Likewise, for recreational lifters, you probably don’t want to be so high in body fat at the start of a gaining phase that you aren’t happy with your body shortly after starting it. Essentially, in each case you want enough of a runway to be able to spend at least a few months in a surplus. My rough guidelines are a maximum of ~15% body fat for men and ~23% body fat for women for beginning a gaining phase. After starting, allow your body fat to climb ~3–5% in the course of a gaining phase before you do a brief ‘mini cut’ (I’ll bring this concept up throughout the text, but for a full description see the end of The Recovery Diet section) to clean things up a tad before you rinse and repeat. But remember, this is The Muscle and Strength Pyramid, not the constantly-cutting-to-be-aesthetic (but not actually succeeding) pyramid. A general recommendation (for those who aren’t starting with high body fat level) is to have a minimum of a 4:1 ratio of the time spent in a gaining phase vs a cutting phase.

It’s not quite as simple as saying: cut if you are high in body fat, gain if you are not. There is also an interaction with training experience. Indeed, I wouldn’t advise someone with obesity who is just starting a weight training program to purposely go on a fat loss plan. Just becoming more active alone can give someone who was previously sedentary more finely tuned hunger signals [4], and body-fat percentage will go down even if muscle is gained without fat mass losses. Also, metabolic health will improve purely from resistance training without dieting.

Therefore we can estimate how much of a surplus or deficit you are in based on weight change. While the “3500 calorie rule” isn’t perfect since not all weight gained or lost is fat and energy expenditure changes over time [2], this value is still a good way to roughly estimate maintenance calories.\\nReason being, you are using a short-term period of 2 weeks and you haven’t manipulated your diet to result in significant changes in body weight or expenditure yet. Thus, changes in weight are predominantly fat and water and using a 7-day average will eliminate the “noise” of water weight fluctuations. So, you can be reasonably sure that the short- term changes in body weight you observe will be well represented by the “3500 calorie rule.”\\nThe only time I wouldn’t advise using this method is if you just started training or are just coming off from a training layoff or injury, as in this case muscle mass can rapidly change and potentially invalidate the equations. However, if you are a natural lifter not coming back from a layoff, not a complete novice lifting for the first time, and if you are relatively weight stable, this is a very easy way to estimate maintenance calories with appropriate accuracy.\\nHypothetically, if you gained 1 lb (~0.5 kg) of fat in a week, you would be, on average, consuming ~500 calories more than your maintenance per day, as 7 days x 500 calories = 3500. So if you only gained 0.2 lb (~0.1 kg), you simply multiply 3500 x 0.2, which is 700 calories. Meaning, in the above example you are in a weekly surplus of ~700 calories.\\nOn a day to day basis, on average, that means you are consuming 100 calories more than your maintenance (700 calories divided by 7 days).

If you have a few years under your belt of training, and you fit into the “intermediate” or “advanced” categories (defined later in this chapter), gaining or cutting does pretty much just come down to your body fat level. However, the answer to this question is also not as critically important as you might believe. There is a common notion that if you aren’t reasonably lean, efforts at gaining will produce a disproportionate amount of fat and little in the way of muscle. This concept is called your ‘P-ratio’, which is simply defined as the proportion of fat to muscle you put on when gaining weight.

However, it might take 24 months to make a visual difference in a physique on the same level during a gaining phase.\\nNow I’d like to clarify, when we discuss gaining muscle throughout this guide, I don’t recommend just eating everything in sight and gaining massive amounts of weight through a classic ‘bulk’ phase as previously identified in the old-school bodybuilding community. That continual addition of body fat will eventually result in a lower strength to body weight ratio for someone who would like to get stronger, and it will make dieting much more difficult and prolonged for someone who would like to eventually cut down for the bodybuilding stage. In fact, a 12-week study comparing rates of weight gain in resistance-trained athletes found that the group that consumed a small surplus gained the same amount of muscle and strength, but only one fifth the body fat as the group that consumed an additional 600 calories [16].\\nNow that doesn’t mean there is never a time to gain relatively quickly, it just depends on how much ‘gaining capacity’ you have. This is determined by how long you’ve been lifting weights and how much of your muscular potential you’ve realized up to this current point. So to establish rates of weight gain, we will differentiate between beginner, intermediate, and advanced lifters with gaining goals. As a note, there’s a great deal of individual variability in how much muscle people can gain. So, there will be people who will do better outside of the range of recommendations, but the following recommendations will work for a good majority of individuals.\\nOn the next page is a chart referring to the recommended rate of weight gain per month:\\nENERGY BALANCE 60' metadata={} - Preview: - It can take 24 weeks to see a significant change in physique by dropping body fat, but it may take 24 months to see a visual difference during a gaining phase.\n",

I know you’re wondering, “Why isn’t the value 3500 kcals?” Well in this case, that is because 3500 kcals is the value of 1 lb (~0.5 kg) of adipose tissue, which is comprised mostly of pure fat, but also contains water and some minerals. When tracking body weight changes at home, the “3500 calorie rule” is a good estimation tool, but lab measurements track changes in pure body fat rather than adipose tissue, and a pound of pure body fat therefore, has a higher energy content.\\nChanges in lean mass, however, carry a much smaller energy value. When using a body composition measuring device such as a DXA scanner, lean mass changes include their respective water contents (and in a 2-compartment model, measuring only fat mass and fat-free mass, water is considered fat-free mass). As I previously mentioned, muscle mass is in large part water, and on top of that, protein (which is what muscle is made of) has less than half the energy per gram than fat does (~4 kcals/g vs ~9 kcals/g, more on this to come next level).

More on the math in a bit, but for now let’s talk concepts.\\nThe original studies on energy availability showed that when energy intake was maintained while exercise energy expenditure was increased, metabolic and reproductive function were negatively affected. Subsequently, when energy intake was raised, the negative effects were reversed [23]. In reading this, it may just seem like energy availability is another term for energy balance. You might be thinking, “I already know an energy deficit can cause downregulation of reproductive and metabolic hormones.” That’s correct; an energy deficit does result in decreased production of metabolic and sex hormones in both men and women, but what is critical to understand is this can occur at energy balance (caloric maintenance, where weight is maintained) as well.\\nENERGY BALANCE 68' metadata={} - Preview: - Energy availability in sport refers to the caloric intake remaining for an athlete after subtracting training energy expenditure.\n",

When using a body composition measuring device such as a DXA scanner, lean mass changes include their respective water contents (and in a 2-compartment model, measuring only fat mass and fat-free mass, water is considered fat-free mass). As I previously mentioned, muscle mass is in large part water, and on top of that, protein (which is what muscle is made of) has less than half the energy per gram than fat does (~4 kcals/g vs ~9 kcals/g, more on this to come next level). Thus, to gain a pound (~0.5 kg) of muscle requires ~830 kcals to be “deposited” in the body (only ~1/5 the energy content of pure body fat).\\nSo what that means is that despite gaining 1.3 lb (0.6 kg) of total weight, the subjects were in a net deficit of 7300 kcals over the course of the study as it requires a surplus of only ~3100 kcals to build 3.7 lb (1.7 kg) of muscle while a loss of 2.4 lb (1.1 kg) of fat meant a ~10,400 kcals energy deficit was “replaced” by burning body fat (10,400 kcals -3100 kcals = -7300 kcals).

This often occurs in physique competitors and weight-class restricted strength athletes in the process of dieting or if they attempt to maintain too lean of a physique. Metabolic adaptation occurs in response to dieting, and some of the adaptive reduction in energy expenditure includes down-regulation of ‘non-essential’ physiological functions, which can persist post-diet if an adequate amount of body fat isn’t regained. Prolonged, low energy availability can have long-term negative health consequences [22].\\nEssentially, energy availability in sport refers to the “leftover” caloric intake for an athlete after training is subtracted for physiological function. This calculated value is expressed relative to lean mass. As an example, a 10% body fat, 100 kg (220 lb) athlete (90 kg or 198 lb of lean mass) consuming 3000 kcal and expending 400 kcal on average in training (2600 kcal “leftover”) is said to have an energy availability of 28.9 kcal/ kg (2600 kcal divided by 90 kg), or 13.1 kcal/lb (2600 kcal divided by 198 lb).

This scenario could also occur while slowly increasing calories after a cutting phase.\\nIt’s also important to point out that these ‘body recomp’ changes, where slight deficits or surpluses produce changes in both muscle mass and fat mass simultaneously, happen slowly. Even in the example I used of overweight elderly men training for the first time, the changes occurred over a four-month time period. It’s not as though large amounts of muscle can be gained while large amounts of fat are lost in a few short weeks, especially in well-trained individuals. This is why dedicated periods of purposeful fat loss and muscle gain are recommended.\\nHowever, advanced drug-free individuals simply can’t gain large amounts of muscle mass in short periods of time. Therefore, the knowledge that the body can slowly gain muscle over long periods of time even without enforced calorie surpluses should give advanced lifters confidence in a slower lean gaining approach.\\nPractical Differences Between Weight Loss and Weight Gain\\nSo, what it all boils down to is that the real difference between weight loss and weight gain is simply that the rate of weight gain should be slower to avoid gaining excessive body fat.\\nThus, to enter a muscle building phase you establish a caloric increase per the relationship between your target rate of weight gain based on your training age and its relationship with the “3500 calorie rule”. Now you don’t need to enforce this caloric increase every day. Calories can vary between days, but this needs to be your average caloric increase from maintenance on a day to day basis over time.\\nOn the next page are the intakes for a 180 lb (82 kg) male and a 130 lb (59 kg) female respectively at each training age, calculated by multiplying 3500 by the target rate of gain per month, divided by 30 to show the daily average increase required:\\nENERGY BALANCE 66' metadata={} - Preview: - Body recomposition changes occur slowly, even with slight deficits or surpluses in calories.\n",

If you followed the guidelines in Level 1, your caloric intake will be based on the appropriate rate of weight gain, weight loss, or maintenance that you calculated.\\nSo, there is value in using both methods. Macronutrients scaled to body weight take into account your mass, which is especially important to consider in the case of protein. Protein is not primarily used as a source of energy (compared to fat and carbohydrate), but rather to build and repair tissues. For this reason, depending on the macronutrient in question, I prefer to use a mix of these two methods.\\nAs I stated, protein’s primary function is to build and repair the structure of our tissues. At most (depending on what we are doing), 10% of our energy might come directly from amino acids (the building blocks of protein). Additionally, the liver can convert protein that is not used for structural purposes to glucose, ketones, and other metabolic substrates which are the body’s main sources of energy. That said, even combining the amount of protein that is used directly for energy with the amount that the liver converts to glucose, ketones or other substrates, the role of protein as an energy source pales in comparison to that of carbohydrate and fat [1].\\nDue to these functions, I calculate protein relative to body weight, with fats and carbohydrates based on a percentage of calories. This allows protein to be scaled to your body mass as its role is primarily structural, while carbohydrate and fat are scaled to your total energy allotment since their primary role is to provide energy.\\nThe other information we need to know is that there are ~9 calories per gram of fat, and then ~4 calories per gram for both carbohydrate and protein. Those values, combined with our daily calories from Level 1 of The Pyramid, will help us assign our macronutrient intakes.\\n76' metadata={} - Preview: - Macronutrient intake should be scaled to the number of calories consumed\n",

So, remember that the rank of importance of each level continues to matter. Additionally, protein can only do so much to protect against losses of lean body mass while dieting.\\nSetting Protein Intake\\nAs I mentioned earlier, protein contributes a small amount to energy expenditure.\\nDuring a diet, this amount increases for several reasons. First, greater levels of activity increase protein requirements [2] and activity goes up when cardio is performed in addition to weight training during a diet. Additionally, protein is used more for fuel because less fat and carbs are available due to caloric restriction [3]. Finally, with less dietary carbohydrate and fat available, more glycogen and body fat are utilized; as their stores decrease, this forces the body to rely more on protein as an energy source [4].\\nBoth dietary and body proteins can be used for energy in the face of this energy shortfall. Thus, to protect against body protein losses, the full-body utilization of protein becomes more efficient [5]. However, this increase in efficiency often does not prevent losses of muscle mass, especially in lean individuals, even when weight training [6].\\nFundamentally, whether or not you gain lean tissue is determined by the combined factors of muscle protein breakdown and muscle protein synthesis (the creation of new muscle proteins).' metadata={} - Preview: - Eating enough protein is important for losing weight while maintaining muscle mass.\n",

A common theory is that during periods of energy deficit, muscle protein breakdown increases, outpacing synthesis, resulting in the often- observed losses in lean body mass. However, published data points out that the primary culprit causing a negative protein turnover ratio may not necessarily be the increase in breakdown rates, but rather a decrease in muscle protein synthesis [7]. However, a wrinkle is that this may only be the case in overweight individuals, while lean individuals may see a significant increase in muscle protein breakdown, as well [8, 9].

When in a cutting phase of any kind, you’re going to have to “rob Peter to pay Paul”, so to speak — you’ll be forcing yourself to either not get enough carbs, protein, or fat simply because you don’t have enough calories in your budget. Therefore, we need to be a bit more cognizant of how our macros are set up during a dieting phase to protect against potential lean body mass losses, and also to improve adherence and maintain gym performance.\\nHowever, if you’ve already screwed up Level 1, you will inevitably have already screwed up your macronutrient distribution as well. For example, if you have ignored the advice from Level 1 and decided to try to lose 1.5–2.0% of your body weight per week, you have to eat fewer calories and thus, you have fewer calories to distribute among your macros.\\nYou may be thinking, “That’s alright, I can just eat a high protein diet to offset this!” but you would be forgetting that protein doesn’t fuel your training, and lifting weights is the primary weapon you have against lean body mass losses.\\nTherefore, someone who is eating a lower protein intake than I would recommend, but who is dieting and losing 0.5 to 1% of their body weight per week, is likely going to maintain more muscle mass than someone\\n77' metadata={} - Preview: - Protein intake should be measured in grams per pound of body weight\n",

Therefore, I always like to set fat first.\\nWhile dieting, as a strength athlete or physique competitor, it makes sense in most cases to lower fat a little more than you would typically in the off-season. This allows for a higher carbohydrate intake which is beneficial because if carbs are too low during energy restriction, in some cases, it can sabotage your training [15, 24–26]. This would then in turn, degrade your ability to retain lean body mass.\\nSo with fat intake, I recommend 15–25% of calories while you are dieting for most people, and then the remaining calories are assigned as carbs. Yes, 15% is lower than ideal in most cases, but that’s why diets don’t last forever.\\nHowever, some people do seem to do fine on lower-carb, higher-fat diets while dieting (although for strength athletes and bodybuilders I normally advise against full-blown ketogenic diets, more on those later) so in these individuals who have a track record to prove the efficacy of a lower-carb approach, an intake as high as 40% is appropriate.\\nAdditionally, we’ll discuss a physiological minimum based on body weight in a moment. But in general, keeping fat a touch lower while dieting allows you to consume more carbohydrate and it’s important to retain enough carbohydrate so you can sustain your training, and in turn, so you can sustain your muscle mass.

      "Summary for doc page_content='THE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: NUTRITION\\nWell, most older people who struggle with higher carbohydrate diets do so because they have lost muscle mass and gained fat mass as time has passed, resulting in insulin resistance. However, even for the folks who have picked up fitness later in life or who are still committed to their resistance training, some independent effects of aging do negatively impact the body’s ability to handle carbohydrate [34].\\nAlso, protein doesn’t continue to give the same anabolic response that it used to as you age [35]. So although your fat and protein might need to increase over the years, just remember that this occurs alongside an overall reduction in energy expenditure [36]. This means you won’t have as many calories to play with overall, which is why you don’t want to go so low on carbohydrates that you become ketogenic unless you find that actually works well for you.\\nSo again, I will say that the recommendations I made are a great place to start for 80% of people who are not overweight, lifting weights regularly, and who have not yet started the final third of their life span (arbitrary number here, but let’s say 60 years old). So, if you are in the first ~2/3 of your lifespan, not overweight, and regularly lifting weights, the recommended ranges will more than likely “work” well for you. For everyone else, I wish I could make a guide that would give you the perfect macronutrient ratio along with a unicorn to ride across the magic dietary rainbow, but the reality is that nutrition is just more individual than that, and you’ll have to bear with me on that limitation.\\nBut How Do I Know if a Higher-fat, Lower-carb or Ketogenic Diet Is Right for Me?\\nAlthough it is not very typical among recreational and competitive bodybuilders and strength athletes to fall into this category, I think it is important to address how to tell if you are someone who would do better with a higher fat-to-carbohydrate ratio.' metadata={} - Preview: - Older people who struggle with higher carbohydrate diets may have lost muscle mass and gained fat mass, resulting in insulin resistance.\n",

However, determining which fibers provide calories and exactly how many is quite difficult [69]. Because of this, my basic recommendation is to simply count your fiber as carbohydrate and to make sure you fall between the minimum and maximum ranges I’ve provided here.

We are not looking at your program, volume, or poundage of weights lifted (you can and should track this as well, but only if you keep your training approach broadly the same so you can compare like-to-like). Rather, this is more about how you perceive your overall effort and mental state during the day’s training. After a month of tracking mood, energy, and gym quality, take an average score of those ratings.\\nWhen that month is complete, repeat the process for another month while consuming a 20% fat diet and keeping calories and protein the same. But you aren’t done yet! If you really want to bring the scientific method into your assessment, I would recommend running this trial a second time, making this whole process a 4-month commitment. If the outcome is repeatable, you can be much more sure it wasn’t some other factor outside of your diet that influenced your scores. At the conclusion, you’ll be able to see if your ratings were higher for one diet or the other both times, and you’ll have your answer.\\nThis might seem like a big hassle to find out whether you do better on a higher-fat or higher-carb diet, but in the off-season, it’s definitely worth it. Also, what’s stopping you? Keeping your energy surplus size, protein intake and training the same (while of course still trying to progress) for four months is not unreasonable. So do it, learn more about yourself! If you see a big difference in these ratings from your 40% fat months and your 20% fat months, you might be able to conclude that a higher- fat diet is something for you to stick to in the long-term.

      "Summary for doc page_content='THE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: NUTRITION\\nJust to set the stage a little bit, macro means big and micro means small. Thus, you need macronutrients in much greater amounts compared to micronutrients.\\nSo far we have only discussed the macros which have been presented in the amounts of full grams. In contrast, when we talk about micronutrients, we are talking about quantities that are very small, from milligrams on down. The occasional time a micronutrient is required in gram level amounts, it is needed in amounts of maybe a couple of grams at most.\\nThat said, these nutrients that we only need in tiny amounts can make a big difference in general health, gym performance, hunger levels, mental state, and overall ability to put on muscle if we happen to have deficiencies in them. This section will go over the types of micronutrients and how to use your food choices to fulfill their daily requirements.

Sometimes, these deficiencies can have significant impacts related to the body composition goals of the individual. We’ll cover some examples here.\\nZinc deficiencies can result in a downregulation of thyroid to the point where energy expenditure is substantially reduced. In one case study, one subject increased their resting metabolic rate (RMR) by 194 kcals after four months of supplementing with zinc, and the other subject increased RMR by a whopping 527 kcals after supplementing with zinc for two months [8]. This is a real-life example of the potential consequences of being “exclusive” in your approach to food source selection versus “inclusive” like we are recommending.\\n    COMMONLY REPORTED MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES BY BODYBUILDERS CIRCA 1989-1994\\n   Vitamin D Calcium Zinc Magnesium Iron\\n Another example of when a micronutrient deficiency can negatively affect your progress is iron, which is an especially common deficiency in female athletes (even more so when energy restricted). In one study on a group of female volleyball players who were supplemented with iron, it was found that during strength testing the iron-supplemented group displayed greater total strength across a range of barbell lifts compared to the control group that did not receive iron supplementation [9].\\nClearly, in some cases correcting a deficiency during dieting can be incredibly important for success.\\nCalcium is another common deficiency and also is required in relatively large amounts.

So it is harder to overdose on a water-soluble vitamin because you can urinate and get rid of the excess. However, it is easier to be deficient in a water- soluble vitamin since we have such a high turnover rate.\\nThe opposite is true for fat-soluble vitamins. It is easier to overdose because they stay in our body longer, and thus, they are also harder to get rid of.

Next, you need to know how to ensure your diet is set up so that you consistently consume an appropriate intake of micronutrients.\\nImplementing The “Inclusive” vs� “ Exclusive” Mindset\\nYou’ll recall from Level 1 that your dietary mindset and outlook are the key ingredients to creating a nutrition plan that will help you progress toward any of your size or strength goals. You want to make sure you include foods high in micronutrients rather than trying to exclude foods that aren’t high in them.\\nThis “inclusive vs exclusive” mindset is especially important while dieting.\\nWhen you are eating less food, you will also be eating fewer micronutrients. Many popular diets, even ones that sound like they have adequate variety and inclusion of various micronutrient-dense foods, are actually micronutrient deficient [1].\\nThe traditional approach to dieting of focusing on “clean” foods and avoiding “dirty” foods popularized by bodybuilders, which supposedly increases the micronutrient density of a diet, can often, in fact, be so restrictive as to leave out key nutrients and result in micronutrient deficiencies [2-6].\\n107' metadata={} - Preview: - Water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished regularly and are easier to overdose on, but also easier to be deficient in.\n",

See the scientifically-validated chart below that can be used to assess your current hydration status [17].\\n 12345678\\n        If your urine color falls within 1–3 you are well hydrated, but if it is 7 or higher you are dehydrated and should consume fluid. However, be aware that the acute effect of some vitamins and multivitamins on urine color can throw this assessment off.\\nThe reason that I tend to favor this method is that at the same body weight, two people can have a very different hydration status. For example, consider one person who has a much higher sweat rate and habitually drinks a lot of fluids, and thus urinates more. This person would have a very high water turnover, while someone else may not. Additionally, other things like quantity and type of training, the type and amount of cardio you’re doing, and the climate you live in are all going to impact your hydration status.\\nAs an example, let’s discuss two extremely different individuals. One is a 200 lb (~90 kg) inactive sweater (doesn’t sweat a lot) living in Alaska who does low-volume weight training 3 times a week in an air-conditioned gym. The other is also a 200 lb (~90 kg) guy who lives in the Middle East, is a profuse sweater, weight trains 6 times a week, does cardio 3 times a week, and has only sporadic access to air conditioning. It’s quite logical to guess that they are going to need massively different fluid intakes to maintain hydration despite having the same body weight.\\nEnsuring you are adequately hydrated is vital because even a 2% decrease in body weight from fluid losses can cause decreases in aerobic performance and as little as a 3% decrease in body weight from fluid loss can negatively impact strength [18].\\n113' metadata={} - Preview: - Hydration can be assessed by visually assessing the color of urine.\n",

The first method we’ll discuss is a basic diet break [1].\\nThe concept of a diet break is essentially just getting your oil changed before your car breaks down. Meaning, instead of dieting until you lose your mind and binge-eat, you simply implement a planned break to avoid the potential negative side effects that can come with a prolonged caloric deficit. Psychologically, this puts you in control of the process versus you breaking down as a consequence of the diet.\\nThe original research on diet breaks found that this intentional “disruption” of weight control in fact, did not disrupt weight loss. Those who implemented diet breaks were able to lose weight just as effectively as those who did not [1]. Additionally, time spent in a deficit can slowly but steadily reduce energy expenditure, thus making further weight loss more difficult as food has to be further reduced and energy expenditure increased. While much of this is unavoidable and simply a result of losing weight and thus, burning fewer calories because you are moving less mass, a large component of this reduction in energy expenditure is what is coined ‘adaptive thermogenesis’ [2] or what is known commonly as metabolic adaptation.\\nNUTRIENT TIMING AND FREQUENCY 118' metadata={} - Preview: - Diet periodization, or incorporating higher-calorie and lower-calorie periods in your diet, can help achieve goals more effectively.\n",

In fact, a 2018 study found that men with obesity who dieted for two weeks, then ate at maintenance for two weeks, lost more body fat and maintained their metabolic rate to a greater degree than a group that dieted straight for the same amount of time without breaks [5]. While we don’t have research in athletes (yet), it would make sense that diet breaks could also help to improve training quality and muscle mass retention by reducing fatigue and replenishing glycogen. But most importantly, a diet break allows you to take a mental time out, get your head right, and catch a breath of fresh air before you dive back under and go through another stint of your deficit.\\nWho Should Use a Diet Break?\\nI recommend this for people who are dieting for three months or longer and who have the time to implement this strategy without missing some sort of hard deadline.

A good example of how you might set this up would be to take someone who has planned a 24-week contest preparation diet. In this scenario, you might plan out two to three diet breaks, more or less evenly spread over the time frame. So for example, they might take week 8, 16, and then 24 (which would also be ‘peak week’, so it would marry up with ‘carb loading’) as diet breaks (hopefully it’s quite obvious that this dietary practice would not be necessary for someone in a lean-gaining phase).\\nI also think autoregulated diet breaks have value.

Some of these techniques are referred to as refeeds, or they may be referred to as ‘carb cycling’, ‘calorie cycling’ or ‘macro cycling’. Regardless of the term, each means that you are distributing calories, and potentially macronutrients, in specific ways across days of the week in hopes of favorable outcomes.\\nWhat we will discuss is arguably the most common iteration, the periodic (often once per week) use of a 24-hour refeed where calories are brought to maintenance primarily via an increase in carbohydrate.\\nWhile this has not yet been specifically studied (although we’ll discuss some studies on 48-hour refeeds shortly), this strategy shares similarities with diet breaks in that one of its purposes is to attempt to reverse metabolic adaptation [6]. Logically, you’d expect the increase in energy expenditure from 24 hours spent at or slightly above maintenance to be small compared to what would be expected after a week-long or multi-week diet break. However, there may still be psychological and physiological benefits to 24-hour refeeds that make them worth implementing. The key is to ensure it is under your control, does not turn into a binge, and is a calculated increase to approximately maintenance calories via an increase predominantly in carbohydrate for the purposes of replenishing glycogen and theoretically increasing leptin to a greater degree (which may help to reduce metabolic adaptations). In addition to potential psychological benefits, this strategy theoretically could help with glycogen replenishment, energy levels, and thus potentially performance and muscle mass retention over the course of a diet.' metadata={} - Preview: - Refeeds, also known as carb cycling, calorie cycling, or macro cycling, involve distributing calories and macronutrients in specific ways across days of the week.\n",

Specifically, to achieve full glycogen replenishment may require the consumption of ~10 g/kg (~4.5 g/lb) in a single day [8] — 800 g of carbohydrate if you weigh 80 kg (176 lb). This level of intake would likely result in a caloric intake above and beyond maintenance, which is not necessary and as I’ll explain in a moment, might be better spread over more days.\\nLikewise, in women, it was shown that the hormonal adaptations due to dieting indicative of menstrual cycle disruption were not effectively reversed by a single day spent far above maintenance calories [9]. Rather, in another study a 48-hour period at roughly maintenance calories did begin reversing these hormonal adaptations [10]. Thus, it seems that not only is the magnitude of calories consumed during a refeed important, but the length of time spent out of a deficit as well. Therefore, for physiological and practicality reasons, a multi-day refeed may prove more advantageous.\\nHowever, this does not mean that 24-hour refeeds are completely without merit. Even if not effective for reversing metabolic and hormonal adaptations to dieting, spending a day out of a deficit is one less day that these adaptations are mounting and a refeed can act to reduce the cumulative effect of days spent dieting to some degree. Remember, just as it takes multiple days of refeeding to effectively reverse these adaptations, it takes multiple days of dieting for these adaptations to occur in the first place, and a refeed is a day of not dieting.\\nWho Should Use Single-Day Refeeds?' metadata={} - Preview: - To achieve full glycogen replenishment, it may require consuming approximately 10 g/kg (4.5 g/lb) of carbohydrates in a single day.\n",

One study found that those who had recently lost 10% of their body weight or more had a total daily energy expenditure of 18% less on average than those at the same body weight who had not dieted [3]. Now, this value of 18% is just the average value. Using the statistics presented in this study and extrapolating them to show the spread for 95% of the people studied, we’d get a range of 8-28%. What this means, is that some people near the end of their diet will be expending just over 90% of the calories that would be predicted by their body weight and activity, thus being only slightly affected by metabolic adaptation. On the other end of the spectrum, some would be nearly down to two-thirds of the energy expenditure that would be expected [3]. As you can imagine, for some people metabolic slowdown can significantly frustrate their weight loss efforts.\\nFortunately, at least part of this adaptive component of energy expenditure reduction can be reversed by increasing calories [4]. In fact, a 2018 study found that men with obesity who dieted for two weeks, then ate at maintenance for two weeks, lost more body fat and maintained their metabolic rate to a greater degree than a group that dieted straight for the same amount of time without breaks [5]. While we don’t have research in athletes (yet), it would make sense that diet breaks could also help to improve training quality and muscle mass retention by reducing fatigue and replenishing glycogen. But most importantly, a diet break allows you to take a mental time out, get your head right, and catch a breath of fresh air before you dive back under and go through another stint of your deficit.\\nWho Should Use a Diet Break?' metadata={} - Preview: - Those who have recently lost 10% or more of their body weight have a total daily energy expenditure of 18% less on average compared to those at the same body weight who have not dieted.\n",

Thus, it seems that not only is the magnitude of calories consumed during a refeed important, but the length of time spent out of a deficit as well. Therefore, for physiological and practicality reasons, a multi-day refeed may prove more advantageous.\\nHowever, this does not mean that 24-hour refeeds are completely without merit. Even if not effective for reversing metabolic and hormonal adaptations to dieting, spending a day out of a deficit is one less day that these adaptations are mounting and a refeed can act to reduce the cumulative effect of days spent dieting to some degree.

      "Summary for doc page_content='What we will discuss is arguably the most common iteration, the periodic (often once per week) use of a 24-hour refeed where calories are brought to maintenance primarily via an increase in carbohydrate.\\nWhile this has not yet been specifically studied (although we’ll discuss some studies on 48-hour refeeds shortly), this strategy shares similarities with diet breaks in that one of its purposes is to attempt to reverse metabolic adaptation [6]. Logically, you’d expect the increase in energy expenditure from 24 hours spent at or slightly above maintenance to be small compared to what would be expected after a week-long or multi-week diet break. However, there may still be psychological and physiological benefits to 24-hour refeeds that make them worth implementing. The key is to ensure it is under your control, does not turn into a binge, and is a calculated increase to approximately maintenance calories via an increase predominantly in carbohydrate for the purposes of replenishing glycogen and theoretically increasing leptin to a greater degree (which may help to reduce metabolic adaptations). In addition to potential psychological benefits, this strategy theoretically could help with glycogen replenishment, energy levels, and thus potentially performance and muscle mass retention over the course of a diet.\\nThere is very little data on refeeds, but what exists is interesting. Speaking to the psychological benefits, dieters reported in a survey that a weekly setup of 1300 kcals 6 days per week with one day at 2700 kcals (weekly total of 10500 kcals) was preferable to a setup of 1500 kcals on all 7 days (also 10500 weekly kcals) [7].

You’ll also eat very large meals that can sometimes cause you to develop unhealthy relationships with food where you train yourself to consume an enormous amount of calories at each sitting. Likewise, you can run into the opposite problem eating more than six meals a day. Having tiny meals every hour or two that don’t satisfy you can leave you constantly focused on food. Either end of the spectrum can exacerbate hunger control [21, 22].\\nSo, my conservative recommendation that combines practical experience, theory, and the limited studies we have [19-26], is to consume somewhere between three to six meals per day in most cases. But that said, if you have previously found success with slightly more or fewer meals than this, that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\\nIf you do fine on two meals per day or seven meals per day, feel free to stick with it. There are plenty of competitive bodybuilders who have found a great deal of success following very high meal frequencies (six to eight meals per day), and likewise there are many folks who have followed an intermittent fasting approach to eating who have had personal or competitive success eating two meals per day (usually involving skipping breakfast) with only whey protein or BCAA prior to training - buy the whey (see what I did there?), save yourself some money and just use protein powder instead of BCAA if you decide to train ‘fasted’.

So, let’s go through all the different information and discuss what is relevant to the goals of muscle and strength gain and retention.\\nPost-Workout Carbs\\nThe primary argument for this is glycogen replenishment. However, in 90% of cases, bodybuilders and strength athletes don’t need to worry about significant glycogen depletion. We’re not doing multiple exhaustive bouts of glycogen depleting training for the same muscle group, and simply put, you will get full glycogen replenishment within a 24-hour period, even on a moderate-carbohydrate diet. This also means you don’t need to worry about the magnitude or speed that a given carbohydrate source raises blood glucose (reflected by its glycemic index, or “GI”).\\nIf you were to do a reasonably high volume of training for a specific muscle group, let’s say 9 to 12 sets for a body part, you might deplete those muscles by as much as 40% of their glycogen levels [19]. After this, most wouldn’t train those muscles again for two to maybe seven days depending on your training program. So you can see that glycogen resynthesis won’t be an issue, because you will definitely replenish that body part’s glycogen in the interim days before you train the muscle group a second time.' metadata={} - Preview: - There are arguments for eating carbohydrates immediately post-workout to maximize glycogen replenishment and spike insulin for improved anabolism and growth.\n",

      "Summary for doc page_content='Far and away, consuming an appropriate amount of protein on a day-to- day basis rather than timing it specifically in relation to training has the largest effect on influencing resistance training adaptation. However, a small effect is still an effect and from a pragmatic standpoint, it is not at all difficult to consume some of your protein within 1–2 hours pre and post workout, and for this reason it has been recommended to consume 0.18 to 0.23 g/lb of body weight of protein (0.4 to 0.5 g/kg) 1–2 hours prior to and after performing resistance training to maximize muscular adaptations [19, 30].\\nConsiderations When Cutting\\nNow that we’ve covered all the theories, to make a safe recommendation that is appropriate for dieting individuals, I would recommend eating a normal sized meal containing both carbohydrate and protein 1 to 2 hours before you train, and again 1 to 2 hours after you train.\\nThis meal should contain roughly 0.2 g per pound (0.4 to 0.5 g/kg) of protein, and should have roughly 10–20% of your daily carbohydrate intake (and 10–15% of your daily fat intake to slow digestion if you experience reactive hypoglycemia) depending on individual tolerance. This will ensure if you have to perform cardio and weight training on the same day that you will be able to perform as well as possible in both sessions, and will also hopefully prevent excessive fatigue when your food levels get low.\\nAs an example, let’s say you are a 155 lb (~70 kg) lifter dropping a weight class and you have a late morning lifting session from 10–11:30 am, and an evening cardio session to complete later that day.

If anything, in some cases you may find because your food volume is so high, that you don’t want to consume as large of a proportion of your food pre-training as you would while dieting to prevent gastrointestinal distress.\\nConsiderations for Extremely Active Athletes\\nNow there may be unique instances where you are doing two or more continuous hours of training. If you’re doing interval training right after your leg day, or if you are doing a really high-volume program and alternating between sets of push and pull, or if you’re not a strength or physique athlete but do a lot of weight training right after your sport- specific training, the timing of nutrition becomes more important. In these cases, it’s not a bad idea to consider pre, post and maybe even intra-workout liquid nutrition to aid performance.\\nIn these cases, I would recommend consuming a drink that contains 8 to 15 grams of protein and 30–60 grams of carbohydrate mixed between pre- and intra-workout if gym time reaches or exceeds 2 hours of continuous, hard training [30].

Less commonly, some supplements that come out are supported poorly by an animal study, short-term study, or an in vitro study that doesn’t directly measure fat loss, muscle gain or performance, but measures an outcome that is related to fat loss, muscle gain or performance. Even more rarely, a new supplement will come out that actually does have a scientific study that supports its effectiveness directly.\\nThis is what I recommend:\\n}In the first case where a supplement has no supporting evidence, simply ignore it.\\n}In the second example where the evidence is shaky at best, I still would not take it. You can keep an eye on the supplement, but don’t get your hopes up. If it really was effective they would have cited studies that demonstrated its effects in an unambiguous way to show its effectiveness.\\n}In the final case where a new supplement comes out with direct scientific support, my advice is still to wait until multiple groups of researchers have confirmed the findings of the first group to ensure that the findings are legit.\\nSUPPLEMENTATION 149' metadata={} - Preview: - The JISSN and Examine.com websites provide information on the validity and effectiveness of supplements.\n",

There is nothing inherently wrong with this, and in general researchers are interested in the truth, get oversight from ethics committees, are third parties, and funding doesn’t go directly to them, but rather towards the research itself. However, there are researchers with conflicts of interest who have financial stakes in companies, who do fraudulent research. While this is disturbing, it is rare. What is unfortunately common, is that when supplement companies fund research, they sometimes include in the contract a clause that states they have the right to decide whether or not the data is published. In my opinion, these contracts should never be signed. But sometimes they are, and you better believe the results don’t get published when they are null. This practice skews supplement research as more positive (including statistically false positives) studies are published, while null findings are repressed.

Often, you’ll see up to 4-digit percentages of the recommended daily allowance (RDA). Something like 4000% of certain vitamins is not that uncommon among some products.\\nThis gross and unnecessary overdose is exactly why I don’t really like massive bodybuilding vitamins that are either giant horse pills or a large packet of pills that you’re supposed to take on a daily basis. If you’ve got the first 3 levels of The Pyramid under control and in order, you should honestly only need a regular one-a-day pill multivitamin that covers your bases and protects against deficiencies. You can also find many basic multivitamins that are geared toward common deficiencies for a certain population, like those specifically made for women or vegetarians with emphasis on calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron.\\nNow that being said, in general, multivitamin use appears to be not harmful and may confer a small protective health benefit to long-term users [11]. Additionally, logic would tell you that when you are eating less food, you will also be eating fewer micronutrients and some studies of popular diets have found that they are actually micronutrient deficient [12]. Therefore, I would say that during a cut it’s probably a good idea to create a nutritional “safety net” and have a daily multivitamin that’s of high quality but that isn’t overdosed. If you’re in a lean-gaining phase, this is most likely not necessary, but might be helpful.' metadata={} - Preview: - The passage discusses the A-list of supplements that have an evidence basis for their benefits.\n",

While the tiredness-suppressing effects of caffeine can be useful for dieters, it is not a dieting aid from a fat-loss perspective.\\nIf your goal is performance enhancement, it might be wise to moderate your habitual, non-pre-workout caffeine intake both in magnitude (~1 mg/kg as a decent cap) and frequency (~2 x/week at most), as tolerance can inhibit the performance-enhancing effect of caffeine to some degree. Caffeine tolerance develops quickly with regular use. However, the pain- suppressing and local-muscle ergogenic effects of caffeine don’t seem to diminish with tolerance [47, 48]; although the endurance training benefits do diminish in some [49, 50], but not all studies [51].\\nIn aggregate, this means that caffeine tolerance will likely diminish the ergogenic benefits for endurance training, but caffeine still probably aids resistance training performance to some degree even in habitual caffeine consumers (but maybe not quite as much as it does for caffeine-naive consumers).\\nSo given tolerance is a reality, if you feel great and you’re ready to train, you might not need to take caffeine pre-workout at all. But if you are feeling down and are anticipating a terrible workout, then it might be a good day to maybe take some. It’s a valuable strategy to keep your caffeine intake as low as possible in order to allow yourself the ability to get those stimulatory effects when it is truly needed. Also, think about the times where suppressing tiredness might be more beneficial than enhancing performance.

Indeed, for purely the acute stimulatory effects, you could just take caffeine and save yourself some cash, as most pre-workout supplements use low doses of lesser proven supplements piggybacked with caffeine. There are some pre-workout supplements that might be effective, but I’d stick to caffeine as there is a multitude of research behind its effectiveness for enhancing performance and suppressing tiredness, while other stimulants don’t have nearly as much behind them.\\nRegarding the evidence-basis for caffeine, I’m going to break this down by discussing two different effects you might be trying to achieve: a suppression of tiredness or enhancement in performance. Then I’ll address the use of caffeine in “fat burners”, before concluding with a discussion on caffeine tolerance.\\nCaffeine is a stimulant, but the initial, cognitive stimulatory effects of caffeine fade with continued use. Fortunately, the suppression of tiredness remains even with continued use and does not appear to be affected by caffeine tolerance [38]. To suppress tiredness doses of 0.5–1.4 mg/lb/day (1–3 mg/kg/day) are appropriate. Also, caffeine can improve acute resistance-training performance, including strength and muscular endurance [39]. To get this effect, take 1.8–2.7 mg/lb (4–6 mg/kg) approximately 60 min before training.\\nIt’s also worth noting that caffeine is often included in so-called “fat burners” with the claim it can enhance fat loss, either through thermogenesis or appetite suppression, leading to a lower energy intake.

But if you are feeling down and are anticipating a terrible workout, then it might be a good day to maybe take some. It’s a valuable strategy to keep your caffeine intake as low as possible in order to allow yourself the ability to get those stimulatory effects when it is truly needed. Also, think about the times where suppressing tiredness might be more beneficial than enhancing performance.

However, to date, there is no evidence that supplementary glutamine improves body composition or performance [69, 70]. At best, there is a theoretical argument that glutamine could possibly aid in gastrointestinal health among physique competitors during contest preparation, although this is speculative at best [69].\\nBranched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)\\nWhether you are cutting or lean gaining, I would have to say that BCAAs probably aren’t going to provide a benefit to you if your protein intake is already high enough.

If that is the case, taking 3–4 g/day may result in a potential small benefit.\\nCitrulline-Malate\\nCitrulline-malate is a supplement that combines the non-essential amino acid citrulline and the Krebs cycle intermediate (meaning, it can help with energy production) malate.\\nCitrulline may aid performance by increasing blood flow to working muscles through an increase in nitric oxide (a vasodilator) [55], and by helping to clear ammonia (a marker of muscle fatigue) [56]. Additionally, malate augments energy production during exercise while reducing the rate at which lactic acid accumulates [57]. In combination, citrulline and malate, therefore, could assist with both energy production and waste removal during training.\\nBased on the mechanisms of action, you would expect citrulline-malate could have a role in aiding muscular endurance, inter-set recovery, and thus, the ability to perform volume in a training bout and over time. However, when assessing the available literature relevant to resistance training, the evidence is split down the middle for citrulline- malate showing a positive [58–62] or null effect [63–67]. While there are currently no meta-analyses published on citrulline-malate, one will likely be published in the future that may give a more definitive answer.

The extreme intakes of both soy and BCAAs in this experiment make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from this study.\\nFinally, there is evidence that aerobic exercise performance can be improved when consuming isocaloric amounts of BCAAs compared to carbohydrate, but only when glycogen depleted [78].

      "Summary for doc page_content='THE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: NUTRITION\\nIssues with Body-Fat Testing\\nAssessing body fat is often considered necessary for body composition related goals because quite logically, body-fat testing can be used to assess if an intervention has been successful in the goal of body recomposition. However, there are a number of considerations that make these tests much more useless than you might realize. For one, many of the “gold standard” methods of body composition analysis such as DXA and, previously, underwater weighing, have substantial enough error rates that they lose utility at the individual level (they are great for studying groups of people though). When properly done, a DXA assessment can’t typically get below a ± 2% error rate for repeated body fat percentage assessment within the same individual [1]. Thus, a measurement of 10% body fat is actually a measurement of 8–12% body fat...and that’s the best-case scenario when the test is conducted by an experienced lab technician using research-grade equipment, standardized protocols, and if the person being assessed does everything in their power to replicate previous testing conditions.\\nMeaning, an athlete who solicits an assessment from a tester with limited experience using commercial grade equipment, who doesn’t ensure that subsequent tests are performed at the same time of day, in a similar proximity to training (of a similar volume and intensity), under similar dietary conditions, with a similar hydration status, and at a similar phase of the menstrual cycle for females, could easily be looking at a ± 10% variation [2]!\\nSo let’s put this into context so you understand why getting a DXA scan regularly is at best not informative and at worst, potentially damaging as it can make you think progress is or isn’t happening, when the opposite is true.' metadata={} - Preview: - Body-fat testing is commonly used to assess body composition goals.\n",

However, if you simply use the sum of skinfolds alone, it is actually highly reliable when assessed by a trained anthropometrist.\\nA skilled assessor should have an error rate of less than 5% on each skinfold measurement [4]. That means that if your sum of six skinfolds was 80 mm, if you were immediately reassessed by that same assessor, the second sum would be within 76–84 mm. This level of reliability allows an athlete to be assessed semi-frequently (say, monthly) to see if skinfolds changed more than 5% (or less, in the case of highly skilled assessors), which would indicate a true change.\\nUnfortunately, people often don’t like this data because they can’t conceptualize what a sum of skinfolds means in the same way they can a body-fat percentage, and it makes it harder to compare themselves to an actual or imagined norm. However, a body-fat percentage is largely useless information anyway (yes, you read that correctly). If you care about how you look, or if you are a physique competitor, you aren’t going for a number; you’re going for a look.\\nLikewise, if you are a performance athlete, you should focus on determining the “sweet spot” in terms of body fatness that allows you to be sustainably (key point) at your best both mentally and physically, as this will result in the best long-term (another key point) performance outcomes.' metadata={} - Preview: - Body fat percentage is highly variable and largely useless information.\n",

However, equally important, and sometimes much more important than your nutrition setup, is learning how to make adjustments to your plan to ensure progress towards your goals, and how to measure progress in the first place.\\nIn this chapter, I’ll go through how to assess progress in the following ways:\\n1� With scale weight: appropriate for weight-class restricted athletes dieting to make weight, physique competitors in a gaining phase, physique competitors during most stages of contest prep, and for non-competitors who don’t have a negative relationship with the scale.\\n2� With visual assessments: appropriate for physique competitors during various phases, but especially important during the final phases of prep, and appropriate for non-competitors in both internal-cue guided cuts (see Behavior and Lifestyle) and gaining phases.\\n3� With performance: appropriate for everyone at various phases, from non-competitors to physique athletes, to strength athletes. Depending on the goal there should be specific trends in either absolute or relative strength. When these trends don’t occur, it’s an indication a change is needed.\\n4� With body circumference measurements: appropriate for fat loss goals as an adjunct or a replacement to scale weight measurements. Useful if you have a negative relationship with the scale, showing progress where muscle gain and fat loss is simultaneously achieved, and also typically shows smaller changes more reliably.\\nBut first, before we dive into these three methods, let me address the question you already have: “What about x, y, or z method of body fat testing?” Good question, glad you asked it.

That means that if your sum of six skinfolds was 80 mm, if you were immediately reassessed by that same assessor, the second sum would be within 76–84 mm. This level of reliability allows an athlete to be assessed semi-frequently (say, monthly) to see if skinfolds changed more than 5% (or less, in the case of highly skilled assessors), which would indicate a true change.\\nUnfortunately, people often don’t like this data because they can’t conceptualize what a sum of skinfolds means in the same way they can a body-fat percentage, and it makes it harder to compare themselves to an actual or imagined norm. However, a body-fat percentage is largely useless information anyway (yes, you read that correctly). If you care about how you look, or if you are a physique competitor, you aren’t going for a number; you’re going for a look.\\nLikewise, if you are a performance athlete, you should focus on determining the “sweet spot” in terms of body fatness that allows you to be sustainably (key point) at your best both mentally and physically, as this will result in the best long-term (another key point) performance outcomes.\\nTo know this, you need reliable data to correlate to your best performances over time, and body impedance, DXA, underwater weighing, and Bod Pod all fail the test on an individual level if you want to get tested with any regularity.

More importantly, you can get perfectly actionable data using the four methods of assessment I mentioned at the start of this chapter.\\nAssessing Scale Weight Change\\nAs I’ve already mentioned in Mindset and Materials, and as I’ll bring up again in the Behavior and Lifestyle chapter, for some there is an emotional cost to self-weighing. It can become the barometer for whether the day is good or bad. However, if you are a weight-class restricted strength athlete or a physique competitor in the early stages of prep, it is also a necessary and valuable tool that you will have to find peace with. For others though, different methods for assessing progress (listed in this chapter and discussed in Behavior and Lifestyle) should be considered.\\nUnderstanding what the scale can and can’t tell you is part of that process of finding peace. For one, remember back to Level 1. In order for you to truly see a change in fat mass of a pound in a single day would require a deficit or a surplus of ~3500 kcal. So unless you ate 5000-7000 kcal, or ate nothing and went on a run, you can be almost certain that the day to day up and down fluctuations in your body weight, which often meet or exceed a pound, are due to changes in water weight and food bulk in the gut.\\nWhile this might provide peace of mind, it also presents a challenge given you want accurate data and to not be chasing water-ghosts and making unnecessary diet changes.\\nThe key to effectively using the scale is to weigh-in at least three times per week (and if only three times per week, once on a weekend day), and to follow these guidelines when doing so:\\n1� Weigh yourself immediately upon waking, after going to the toilet (if you need to).\\n2� Place your body weight scale on a flat, hard surface (not a rug or carpet), then weigh yourself nude.\\n3� Record this weigh-in in an Excel spreadsheet or simply write it down.\\nMAKING ADJUSTMENTS AND MEASURING PROGRESS 180' metadata={} - Preview: - Scale weight change can be a valuable tool for weight-class restricted strength athletes or physique competitors in the early stages of prep.\n",

I’ll be generous and say you get the error rate down to ± 5% in this hypothetical. Now let’s assume you are following the guidelines in this book, and you’re losing ~0.75% of your body weight per week (middle of the 0.5–1% recommendation). If you are a 154 lb (70 kg) individual, you’re losing 1.1 lb (0.5 kg) per week. If you start at 20% body fat, that’s 30.8 lb (14 kg) of body fat. So each week, if you lose pure fat mass, you lower your body fat percentage ~0.3%. If you could wave a magic wand and lose only body fat, you’d lose 1.2% body fat every 4 weeks. Let’s say that magic wand also gave you perfect knowledge of your body fat percentage at each time point; if so it would tell you this:\\n1. 4 weeks in: body fat 18.8% 2. 8 weeks in: body fat 17.6% 3. 12 weeks in: body fat 16.4% 4. 16 weeks in: body fat 15.2%\\nNow, here’s what that DXA scanner might have reported with an error of ± 5%. To get this, I used the Google random number generator and just added “5” to either side of the above four values.

However, an easy way to tell if you were way off, is what happens in the first-week. While above I said the first week of data should be ignored, I meant largely that you should ignore the amount of weight gain or loss, as it’s not representative of true tissue changes. However, if you put yourself into an appropriate surplus or deficit there should be a change in weight in the direction you are attempting to go. Meaning, the added food bulk, sodium, glycogen storage and subsequent increase in body water when starting a gaining phase, should result in an increase in body weight when looking at your first week data. Likewise, the reduced food bulk, sodium, glycogen storage and subsequent decrease in body water when starting a fat loss phase, should result in a decrease in body weight when looking at your first-week data. If that didn’t happen, you can bet you either over or underestimated your activity multiplier, and you’ll need to make a significant adjustment. So if weight doesn’t go up when starting a gaining phase, or down when starting a fat loss phase, recalculate your calories with an increased or decreased activity multiplier of 0.2, respectively. For example, if you set up your gaining diet with a 1.5 multiplier and your average weight didn’t increase in week one, go to 1.7.

      "Summary for doc page_content='Visual assessments for physique competitors become increasingly important as prep progresses. For example, a bodybuilder at the tail end of prep who only has 2 lb (0.9 kg) left to lose, but four weeks to lose it in, may not be able to discern if a plateau has occurred at all if only looking at scale weight (as the fluctuations may mask the loss, and there is not enough time to observe changes). You’ll have to rely on visual assessments. Fortunately, when someone only has this amount of fat left to lose, small changes become much more obvious visually on a week to week basis.\\nSo how do you get good quality visual assessments? First, don’t look in the mirror and go off memory. Actually take a short video of you going through repeated poses, or take pictures. Make sure the light source is facing you, and the camera is between you and the light source. So for example, you face a ceiling light, and your significant other is between you and the ceiling light taking your picture. This will provide an honest view of your physique. Also, be consistent, each time you take pictures do it in the same lighting.\\nUnfortunately, the higher in body fat you are, the less obvious visual changes will be. On the flip side, the leaner you are, the more obvious they will be. So visual assessments are really only useful for informing changes when you are reasonably lean. Similar to the recommendations for adjustments based on scale weight, if you are reasonably lean and dieting, assess visual progress over 2–3 weeks. If you don’t see improvements in leanness visually, make a reduction in calories in the way we previously described, or add cardio.\\nOn the other hand, if you are gaining weight (remember muscle gain is a much slower process than fat loss), or not very lean, visual assessments really aren’t that helpful for making adjustments.

However, while some of these practices are useful tools that make a small difference, many traditional practices lack a physiological basis. In fact, some of the most common practices can be potentially dangerous, actually harmful to appearance, and may be rooted in protocols only useful for athletes using pharmaceutical enhancement (if they are useful at all). Therefore, it’s important to understand which approaches make sense, which don’t, why, and how and when to apply them.\\nCarbohydrate Loading\\nTraditionally, ‘carb loading’ — the act of purposefully increasing carb intake prior to a stage appearance or sport performance — was a tool used by endurance athletes to maximize glycogen storage and thus extend the amount of time they could perform a (relatively) high- intensity effort. Since the vast majority of carbohydrate is stored in skeletal muscle, bodybuilders have taken interest in carb loading as a method to acutely increase the appearance of muscle size.\\nIn studies of carb loading, many protocols have been employed with various effects on glycogen storage and performance. For physique competitors, the only relevant outcome is how much glycogen ends up being stored. It has been repeatedly shown that if one goes from a high-carb diet to a low-carb diet and/or glycogen depleting training protocol, and then follows that up with a carb load, they will acutely reach higher levels of muscle glycogen than previously. However, the traditional carb load used by performance athletes isn’t a perfect fit for a physique competitor. Performance athletes don’t care about their appearance and load with very high carb intakes in the realm of 12 g/ kg (5–6 g/lb) to ensure maximal glycogen storage [2].' metadata={} - Preview: - Traditional carb loading was originally used by endurance athletes to maximize glycogen storage and extend high-intensity performance.\n",

To answer this question we can turn to observational studies. In one observational study of bodybuilders who were performing carb loading as a part of their pre- contest preparation, an increase in biceps thickness was observed the day prior to the competition. At the end of contest preparation, muscle growth is very unlikely to be occurring. Thus, the increase in thickness was quite possibly a result of carbohydrate loading [5].\\nWhile anecdotal, I can say with confidence from my years of coaching experience that carb loading does seem to have an impact on appearance. The potential impact can be positive if you are able to load to the point of fullness, and harmful if you load past that point and spill over. The strategies utilized to achieve this ideal state can be divided into two main approaches: ‘front loading’, and ‘back loading’. The difference is the timing of when the carbs are loaded in the week leading up to the competition.\\nIn front loading, there is a load earlier in the week, then it tapers down, and then you load again in the day(s) prior to stepping on stage.

Besides the obvious benefits, doing all of the above has the added benefit of making your body much more predictable when it comes time to carb load.

I have never personally seen a natural competitor improve their appearance with cutting water, cutting sodium and/or loading potassium. At best, I’ve known competitors who don’t harm their physique by doing this. At worst, I’ve seen competitors make themselves feel terrible and degrade their appearance.\\nTraining Considerations for Peak Week\\nThough the broad topic of training is covered in the companion book, this section would be incomplete without recommendations on how to manipulate training variables in the final week prior to competition.\\nYou still want to train hard the week of the show to maintain the stimulus to the muscles to store glycogen, but you want to avoid training that causes inflammation or delayed onset muscle soreness. This could extend into game day and hurt your posing ability or hamper your muscles’ ability to handle carb loading. I’ve seen some tight lineups where competitors are on stage for 40–60 mins, which is another reason not to cut water and electrolytes.\\nPEAKING FOR COMPETITION 205' metadata={} - Preview: - Water and electrolyte manipulation has been a common practice in bodybuilding, possibly due to the lack of access to certain drugs in the past.\n",

However, some people fall right on the cusp of a weight class. This limits them to two realistic classes; one they can do an acute weight cut to make and the one they settle at, and two classes they can work very hard to reach; one requiring a long-term diet and substantial weight loss, and one requiring a long-term gaining phase and substantial weight gain. But, just because you have these options doesn’t mean they are all equally beneficial options.\\nNovice lifters or teenagers who aren’t done growing, shouldn’t intentionally change classes. Those still maturing or experiencing novice-gains are not yet at their “trained” adult weight. Dropping a class can hamper strength and size development and maturation for teenagers [15]. Also, weight gain will come naturally without force- feeding to a higher class, so yes, a teenager should be going up in weight but they shouldn’t be trying to; this should just be a function of growing like any other kid.\\nIntermediate powerlifters should also think carefully before dropping down. Often, these lifters are on the cusp of impressive numbers, just shy of being among the elite. However, going from ‘good’ to ‘elite’ is a longer journey than going from novice to good. It is tempting to think, “If I maintained my numbers and dropped a class I would be elite!” While true, this often isn’t realistic or sustainable.

For those who began with low to moderate levels of body fat, this will often mean going up 1–2 weight classes over one’s career. How much weight you gain and thus, how many classes you end up competing in over the course of your career also depends on what age you began competing, and your genetic propensity for putting on muscle.

Outside of the “super heavyweight” categories where everyone above a certain cut-off is grouped in the same weight class with no upper limit, you compete in a class based on upper and lower bounds of body weight. Many competitors, therefore, manipulate their body weight to fall within a specific class, often through a combination of chronic weight loss from dieting, and acute weight loss primarily through (but not limited to) reductions in body water.\\nGenerally, fitting into the weight class where you have the greatest power- to-weight ratio (i.e. the combination of the most muscle mass at the lowest body weight) gives you a competitive advantage. However, that doesn’t mean everyone should cut weight.

While fiber is great for long-term gut health and it is one of the reasons why fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are considered part of a balanced diet, they also slow the digestive process and leave more fecal matter in your colon. Spending 2–4 days on a <10 g/day fiber diet can reduce the weight of the contents of your digestive tract. In addition to a lower fiber count, eating foods that are energy dense and low in weight to reach your caloric and macronutrient targets is a good idea.

But, you’ll also recall that a ketogenic diet can leave an athlete feeling fatigued initially before they adapt. This is something we want to avoid. Meaning, we could leverage a low carb — but not full-blown keto — diet to lose some extra weight.\\nA decent guideline is to trade carbs for fats. I typically use an isocaloric exchange of dropping carbs by 45 g (180 kcal) and increasing fat by 20 g (180 kcal) each day in a tapered fashion, starting the Sunday before a Saturday competition to ease the person in, and I also don’t take carbs below 1 g/kg to avoid the often reported “keto fatigue”.\\nWhile theoretically, this should be a pretty safe way to reduce body water without actually inducing dehydration (and in my experience it can result in another ~1% reduction in body mass), I’ve heard some lifters report that they just feel a bit off when doing this. Perhaps this is a metabolic effect or the feeling of slightly depleted muscles. I’m not sure, but I think it’s probably something to only do if you need to lose closer to the 4–5% body weight range.' metadata={} - Preview: - Low-carb diets do not harm strength in the short-term\n",

Hypothetically, you’ll be lean, calories will be high, and you will be ready to make great progress and start your next diet with more muscle mass, less body- fat, and eating as many calories as possible.\\nNow, all of those are good things but unfortunately the reverse diet when taken too far, rarely delivers them. In its more extreme iterations, the reverse diet may result in you spending many weeks in an energy deficit, even after your diet, before you are in a surplus. That may strike you as odd, or perhaps not and maybe you’re wondering, “Why does that matter?”\\nLet me explain.' metadata={} - Preview: - When transitioning from a diet to maintenance, it is recommended to start with a conservative estimation of maintenance by cutting cardio in half and increasing calories by 200-400 per day.\n",
      "- It is not known exactly how much energy expenditure decreases after a long diet, so it is best to be conservative and gradually increase calories until reaching maintenance or a desired rate of weight gain.\n",
      "- Once reaching a sustainable body fat level, a qualitative approach to nutrition can be taken for long-term health and a healthier relationship with food.\n",
      "- The reverse diet is a post-competition strategy for physique athletes that involves slowly increasing calories after a contest preparation diet to eventually reach maintenance or slightly beyond.\n",

If you are doing back to back shows just one week apart, you’ll simply keep dieting after peak week is over. Maybe you can work in a controlled celebratory dinner the night after the competition, but it can’t be an all-you-can-eat feast. If your next show is another 2, 3, or 4 weeks away, you can have either a celebratory dinner after the competition or a celebratory breakfast the morning after.\\n}When you have a celebratory meal, take into consideration that it is occurring at the tail end of a peak-week where you ate higher calories and carbohydrates for at least a few days. Thus, the meal doesn’t need to be huge.\\n}For a post-competition dinner, a serving of meat with steamed vegetables is a safe bet.\\n}Focus on the time spent with your friends and family that have come to support versus trying to satisfy every possible craving.\\n} If you’re a vegetarian or only eat fish, you could have either a tofu salad (or similar) or fish and steamed vegetables; in either case, find something that has a similar energy and macronutrient content to the meat eater’s example.\\n} Or, if you can wait until the next morning, just skip the celebratory dinner and go out for a traditional breakfast the next morning with your friends and family. Bacon and eggs, with a few slices of toast, or hash-browns would be a solid choice.\\nIf your show is over a month away but less than four months away, you can probably get away with having both a celebratory dinner and breakfast.\\nTHE RECOVERY DIET 231' metadata={} - Preview: - The recovery diet after a competition depends on whether there are more shows to do or if the season is finished.\n",

But after a competition, you are incredibly lean, so lean it makes gaining muscle harder, and I want a larger surplus because the goal is to gain not only muscle but some fat as well. In many cases to achieve a body weight 5–10% above stage condition, a 400 to 1,000 calorie surplus (which, if you are in a deficit often means adding 600 to 1,500 kcal to your diet with a cardio reduction) is needed (depending on how much of a “head start” you got the night of the show and the day after).

For most people, neither is sustainable and both share the weakness of asking you to rely on external cues (a meal plan or three numbers) while ignoring internal cues (sensations of hunger and fullness) and promote a black and white mindset. You’re either on your meal plan or off it, or you either hit your macros or you didn’t (see “Magic Macros” in the Mindset and Materials section). Fortunately, this doesn’t have to be the case.\\nThe solution for those who aren’t dieting, or for non-competitors looking for long-term plans, is to seek non-binary approaches. Meaning, it’s not either a zero or a one, black or white, on or off.

Early on in this book, I explained the importance of developing this mindset, now I am going to give you systems to apply the concepts.\\nThe first system I want to introduce, is the 3-Tiered approach to tracking, which is appropriate for when you do have to track: such as during contest prep, cutting to a weight class, or fat loss goals which you weren’t able to achieve with qualitative changes — which we’ll discuss more in this chapter later on (and remember, if you can’t get there without qualitative, habit-based interventions, you have to consider if the goal is sustainable).\\nDefining the Tiers' metadata={} - Preview: - The passage discusses the limitations of relying solely on external cues, such as meal plans or specific numbers, for nutrition.\n",

When coaching my contest-prep athletes, I typically give them a daily target for the three macronutrients and decrease or increase them based on the rate of weight loss that occurs on a week to week basis (while also looking at body comp change via pictures and weight room performance). During weight loss, the specific balance of macronutrients becomes more important because there is an imposed maximum energy intake and an increase or decrease in any macronutrient necessitates the subsequent increase or decrease in another to maintain the caloric deficit.\\nFor this reason, I use a relatively tight range for the macronutrients, often + or - five to 10 grams while dieting. This degree of accuracy helps the dieting athlete walk the “tightrope” as described in my analogy above. However, it also requires attention to detail, the use of tracking software or applications, a digital food scale, abstaining from eating out the majority of the time, and planning some meals or even entire days in advance when traveling.

A greater amount of energy is created by metabolizing body protein in lean individuals compared to those overweight [1], and when lean individuals are calorie restricted they experience a reduction in testosterone [2] while those who are overweight likely will not [3]. For these and other reasons, the leaner you are the more likely you are to lose lean body mass during weight loss [4].\\nAdditionally, resistance training depletes glycogen to a degree [5] and when glycogen depleted (which is more likely to occur while dieting), muscular performance can degrade [6]. Resistance training is also partially fueled by intramuscular triglyceride which is depleted to a degree alongside glycogen during resistance training [7], and a diet low in fat may not completely replenish intramuscular triglyceride levels [8].

For example, when a target is not perfectly hit, this simply means that you broaden the target by dropping to another level on the precision scale and carry on.\\nTo build upon this notion, here are the basics of our three nutritional tracking tiers:\\nBEHAVIOR AND LIFESTYLE 249' metadata={} - Preview: - The solution for non-dieting individuals or those not competing is to seek non-binary approaches.\n",
      "- There is a continuum of options to follow based on the demands of the situation.\n",

      "- The 3-Tiered approach to tracking is appropriate for situations where tracking is necessary, such as contest prep, cutting to a weight class, or fat loss goals.\n",
      "- Life is not always exact, so a flexible approach allows for slight deviations without \"falling off the diet\".\n",

That way, if a planned event is coming up or if you simply are very hungry on one day or not hungry at all on another day, you can shift your calories around. A 20% reduction on any isolated day in a non-dieted and depleted body is going to have very little impact on anything of import, and it allows one to mix and match to account for the occurrences of real life.\\nAnother way to institute borrowing is to set up an excel sheet that calculates a 7-day average of your calories for the week. You can simply have the goal of hitting the target calories on average by the end of the week. When doing so, by the end of the 7-day period, if your daily goal was 2500 kcals for example, so long as you averaged that over the 7-day period, you’ve met your goal for the week. This way, you can have a day at 3000 calories, a day at 2000 calories, a day at 2700, a day at 2300 and then the remaining three days at 2500 calories and that’s absolutely fine, rather than having to rigidly consume 2500 calories every day. This is just an example mind you, I don’t actually recommend bouncing around that much. Having a foundation of structure and consistency is actually ideal, but you don’t want to be so rigid you can’t adapt to life, which is where borrowing can help.\\nEating Out\\nSo now that you’ve got some systems (3-Tiers and Borrowing) to implement during periods where you have to track, it’s important that you are able to implement them outside of your own kitchen when out with friends and family.

This is not to say one can’t maintain a healthy body image and relationship with food while tracking and self-weighing. Indeed, self-weighing and tracking can be helpful tools to learn about the quantitative side of nutrition. They also can be used to ensure you are meeting the best-practice guidelines for body recomposition and performance enhancement outlined in Levels 1–5. However, the more one relies on external cues to dictate energy intake and eating behavior, the more they must consequently ignore natural, internal cues of hunger and satiety, which can have lasting consequences [13]. For this reason, the end-goal for a competitor should be to get to a point where meeting the guidelines of Levels 2–5 becomes “automated” into one’s lifestyle habits, and then internal cues are used to guide total energy intake (Level 1) for the larger part of a lifting career (e.g. being in a surplus or at maintenance). Subsequently, external cues should only dominate your approach as needed when hunger signals run directly counter to an athletic goal; such as when dieting to reach a weight-class cutoff, or to step on stage.' metadata={} - Preview: - Regular self-weighing and tracking calories and macros can be helpful tools for learning about the quantitative side of nutrition.\n",
